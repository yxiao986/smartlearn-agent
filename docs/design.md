# SmartLearn Agent - Product Design

## User Stories

1. As a sudent, I want to upload a PDF and ask questions about it, so that study more efficiently.
2. As a sudent, I want to get answers with page numbers, so that quickly find the original content in the PDF.
3. As a sudent, I want to ask follow-up questions in a conversation, so that deepen understanding of a topic.

- Multi-file support — perfect the single-PDF experience first
- Mobile app — web version only

## Data Flow

### Day 2: Simple Mode

PDF File
  -> [PDF parser / extract text]          # How do we get text out?
  -> pages[]
  -> [Build prompt: pages + question]          # How do we combine with question?
  -> [LLM]
  -> Answer with [Page X]

### Day 3: RAG Mode

PDF -> [extract text] -> pages
    -> [split into chunks] -> chunks with source_page
    -> [embed] -> embeddings
    -> [vector store (FAISS)]  # storage

Question -> [encode] -> [similarity search] -> relevant chunks -> [LLM] -> Answer
